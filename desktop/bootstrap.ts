//
// esbuild hoists every external import to the top of the bundle it emits, so a
// single unresolvable dependency — a damaged app.asar, a module quarantined out
// of app.asar.unpacked — aborts module evaluation before any of our code runs.
// The process then exits into a console a double-click never has: no window, no
// dialog, nothing to report. That is issue #140's first failure
// (`Cannot find package 'jieba-wasm'`), and neither boot()'s catch nor the
// packaged asset preflight can reach it, because both live inside the bundle
// that failed to load. Keeping the application in a second bundle that this one
// imports dynamically turns that abort into a catchable rejection.
//
// Anything that must run before Electron initializes V8 or emits 'ready' also
// belongs here: the dynamic import below settles asynchronously, so module-scope
// work inside the application bundle no longer happens before the first tick.
